This calculator estimates how much HR automation can reduce HR staffing needs and salary costs based on your industry and company size.

A key factor in this calculation is **productivity gain** ‚Äî the expected improvement in efficiency when routine HR tasks are automated.  
For example, if automation improves productivity by 30%, your company may require fewer HR staff to manage the same number of employees, resulting in cost savings.

**Adjusting Productivity Gain**

Use the slider below to estimate how much efficiency improves with HR automation.

- A **higher percentage** reflects greater improvements (e.g., automating repetitive admin tasks).
- A **lower percentage** reflects modest changes (e.g., partial digitalization).

üí° If you're unsure, a **30% productivity gain** is a typical estimate for companies starting to adopt HR automation.
